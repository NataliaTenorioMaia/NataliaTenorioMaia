#### About me

<img align="right" src="nat.jpg" width="50%"/>

<p align="justify">
I am a Physics PhD who is currently working as an AI/ML Applied Scientist using NLP and Generative AI to solve problems in Healthcare. In recent years, I have been working in the R&D sector, leading the development of frameworks in Python and applying Machine Learning algorithms and Large Language Models to solve complex business problems. Although my current work and interests are more aligned with the responsibilities of a Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer, I also have experience working as a Data Scientist doing data analysis, data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and client communication. 

Prior to working in Industry, I worked as a Physics Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. In that role, I conducted research and published papers in Gravitational Waves and Effective Field Theory, led and managed projects while mentoring PhD students, organized conferences, gave talks in the US and abroad.

I am passionate about tackling challenging and complex problems, especially in collaboration with other curious peers. I love to work on projects that allow me to continue learning, improving my depth and breadth in Science, while building solutions that benefit people.
